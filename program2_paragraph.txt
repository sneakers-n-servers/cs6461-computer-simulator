System architecture is the structural design of systems. Systems are a class of software that provide foundational services and automation. The following are illustrative examples of system architecture.A basic approach to architecture is to separate work into components. These may be designed to be reusable. Components also serve to reduce extremely complex problems into small manageable problems. The difference between a costly, unstable, low performance system and a fast, cheap and reliable system often comes down to how well it has been architected into components.
